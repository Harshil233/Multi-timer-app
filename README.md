- Timers are stored locally using localStorage (no backend or external DB)
- Unique timer IDs are generated using `Date.now()` timestamp
- Time is internally managed in seconds and displayed as hh:mm:ss
- Timer countdowns use `setInterval` updated every second
- A halfway alert will only trigger once per timer, if set
- When a timer hits 0, it's automatically marked as Completed
- Pause and Start button are disabled as soon as the timer gets completed
- Minimal third-party dependencies ‚Äî no external CSS libraries or frameworks are used
- Basic CSS is used to maintain a clean, simple UI
